## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** 20.0 or higher ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **Bun** (optional, but recommended) ([Install](https://bun.sh/))
- **Git** ([Download](https://git-scm.com/))

You'll also need accounts for:
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (free tier available)
- [Groq](https://groq.com/) (for AI API access)

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0rion-Labs/FocusEdu.git
cd FocusEdu
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

Choose your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Using Bun (fastest, recommended)
bun install

# Using npm
npm install

# Using Yarn
yarn install

# Using pnpm
pnpm install
```

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# ============================================
# Firebase Configuration
# ============================================
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# ============================================
# AI/ML Configuration
# ============================================
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key

# ============================================
# Email Configuration (Optional)
# ============================================
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_password

# ============================================
# Application Settings (Optional)
# ============================================
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Never commit your `.env.local` file. It's already included in `.gitignore`.

#### 4. Set Up Firebase

1. Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Authentication (Email/Password, Google Sign-in)
3. Create a Firestore database (start in test mode)
4. Enable Firebase Storage
5. Copy your configuration to `.env.local`

#### 5. Obtain Groq API Key

1. Sign up at [Groq Cloud](https://console.groq.com/)
2. Navigate to API Keys section
3. Generate a new API key
4. Add it to your `.env.local` file

#### 6. Run Development Server

```bash
# Using Bun
bun dev

# Using npm
npm run dev

# Using Yarn
yarn dev

# Using pnpm
pnpm dev
```

#### 7. Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build the application
bun run build  # or npm run build

# Start production server
bun start      # or npm start

# Run linting
bun run lint   # or npm run lint
```
